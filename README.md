# Tolgee CLI 🐁

An experimental 🧪 command line tool to interact with Tolgee directly from your terminal.

The CLI lets you pull strings from the Tolgee platform into your projects, push local strings to the Tolgee platform,
extract strings from your code, and much more!

- Pull requests welcome! 🤩

## Installation
The Tolgee CLI is published as a NPM package. You simply need to install it, and you're good to go!
```sh
npm i --global @tolgee/cli
```

> **Warning**: The Tolgee CLI is currently experimental and subject to bugs. Breaking changes may happen before stable release!
>
> Help us reach stable version faster by reporting any bug you encounter on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli/issues/new?labels=bug).
